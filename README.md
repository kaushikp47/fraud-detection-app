🚀 **[Try Live Demo](https://fraud-detection-app-rkjfxxtoehiqrp4peddm5o.streamlit.app/)** 

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://fraud-detection-app-rkjfxxtoehiqrp4peddm5o.streamlit.app/)

> An AI-powered machine learning system that detects fraudulent credit card transactions with 97.4% accuracy using Random Forest and SMOTE balancing techniques.

## 🎯 Key Highlights

- **97.4% ROC-AUC Score** - Excellent fraud discrimination capability
- **85% Recall Rate** - Catches 85% of all fraudulent transactions  
- **91% Precision** - Minimizes false alarms
- **Real-time Analysis** - Instant fraud probability predictions
- **Business Impact** - Potential $2.1M annual savings for mid-size banks

## 🚀 Live Demo

Visit the live application: **https://fraud-detection-app-rkjfxxtoehiqrp4peddm5o.streamlit.app/**

Try different scenarios:
- Low Risk: Small amounts, normal patterns
- High Risk: Large amounts, suspicious patterns
- Random: See how the model handles varied transactions

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| ROC-AUC | 97.4% |
| Precision | 91% |
| Recall | 85% |
| F1-Score | 88% |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Random Forest, SMOTE
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## 💡 Key Technical Challenges Solved

1. **Extreme Class Imbalance** - Only 0.17% of transactions were fraudulent
2. **SMOTE Implementation** - Synthetic minority oversampling for balanced training
3. **Model Optimization** - Improved recall from 65% to 85% while maintaining precision
4. **Production Deployment** - Scalable web application with real-time predictions

## 🎓 What I Learned

- Handling severely imbalanced datasets in real-world scenarios
- Importance of choosing appropriate evaluation metrics (recall vs precision trade-offs)
- End-to-end ML pipeline: data preprocessing → training → deployment
- Business impact analysis and ROI calculation for ML projects

## 📈 Business Impact

For a bank processing **1 million transactions/month**:
- Expected fraud: ~1,700 cases
- Model detection: ~1,445 cases (85% recall)
- **Monthly savings: $176,000**
- **Annual savings: $2.1 million**
